I started my career with Best Buy in 2003 at the Sugar Land location as a part time associate in Home Theater.&nbsp; As my passion for higher end audio/video grew, I rose in the ranks from my part time role to one of the elite Magnolia Professionals in 2007. I was given the opportunity to work closely with our home entertainment advisors to build custom experiences for my clients, which furthered my interest in higher end solutions. &nbsp;Getting the best quality from a professional is important to me, which is why I strive to give nothing short of the best experience for all of my clients based on their needs.&nbsp; Working in the Magnolia Design Center located in the heart of the&nbsp;Austin area has allowed me to further focus on client experience, just as Magnolia has for the past half century. It is with this shared vision of 100% satisfaction that I look forward to many more years within this field that I am so passionate about.</p>"",""""
